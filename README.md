# Intquant
Compress and store floating point arrays through integer quantization and compression.

## Overview
Intquant supports lossy use of floating point arrays in JavaScript/TypeScript, through quantization to integers (8-bit and 16-bit currently supported) and compression to base64 strings that take up little space in JSON.
